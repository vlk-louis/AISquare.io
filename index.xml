      <description>AI-Enhanced 3D-Printed Prosthetics for Cranial Asymmetry In the world of healthcare, technological advancements are breaking new ground, and at the forefront of these innovations is the revolutionary field of AI-enhanced cranial care for infants with cranial asymmetry.
Cranial asymmetry, a condition characterized by the misshaping of an infant&amp;rsquo;s skull, has historically been addressed with corrective helmets. However, the traditional approach to designing these helmets has been time-consuming and costly.
Here, we dive into the groundbreaking techniques we&amp;rsquo;ve employed, integrating cutting-edge AI and 3D printing to create a faster, more cost-effective solution.</description>

      <description>In the realm of infrastructure and IoT, where hardware reigns supreme, the promise of predictive maintenance and cost efficiency is no longer a futuristic concept. We delve into the heart of this transformative technology that we are creating in collaboration with major ports in Asia.
Enhanced Predictive Maintenance (Hardware Lifecycle Analysis): Along with predicting when a component might fail, the system continuously monitors the lifecycle of the hardware. It keeps a track record of when devices start to degrade in performance versus compared to its optimal specs.</description>

      <description>Navigating a Sea of Information: Revolutionizing Global Shipping with AI The world of global shipping is a complex web where an avalanche of information converges from myriad sources - partners in the supply chain, clients, and the troves of internal data. This data, a heterogeneous mix of paper-based documents, digital files, and client-generated data, is the lifeblood of the industry, steering the colossal vessels carrying goods across the oceans.
Yet, within this labyrinth of data, there lies a formidable challenge: ensuring that containers clear customs quickly and arrive at their intended destinations.</description>

      <description>Louis and I first crossed paths in 2011 while working at a startup in Montreal. Boasting backgrounds in computer graphics, our connection was almost immediate. Conversations ranged from the nitty-gritty of tech to broader, existential topics that questioned the very fabric of our reality.
In 2013, life pulled us in different directions. I relocated to San Francisco while Louis made Singapore his new home. On touching down in SF, I was met with an avalanche of new tech jargon: cloud computing, node.</description>
