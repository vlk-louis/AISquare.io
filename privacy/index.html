<p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
<p>The information we collect includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called &ldquo;crash dumps&rdquo;), and hardware settings).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Device Data. We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Services.

<li>
<p>Location Data. We collect location data such as information about your device&rsquo;s location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3 WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p>*<em>In Short:</em>*
We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>
<p><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Consent.</strong>
We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about <a href="#withdrawconsent">withdrawing your consent</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong>
We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop and display personalized and relevant advertising content for our users</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support our marketing activities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong>
We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vital Interests.</strong>
We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>\If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
<p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can <a href="#withdrawconsent">withdraw your consent</a> at any time.</p>
<p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</p>
</li>
<li>

You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section &ldquo;<a href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>&rdquo; below.

<p><strong>9 CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>

At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized.
